# Robot programming

## Used technology

Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Summary of the program

User can move robot in two-dimensional room using commands in 3 languages.

## Details
Firstly user should choose form, size and starting coordinates of robot room. If user choose size smaller than 1 or starting coordinates outside of the room, they get error message.
If user choose correctly, they will see input field for the command and image of the robot room with robot in starting position.

User should choose language from dropdown menu and enter command in following language.
If command is incorrect or result is outside robot room, user will receive error message.
If command was correct, user will see new user coordinates, new direction and updated image of robot room with robot position.

## Additional features

• I've added dynamic image of robot room with robot position to visualize it's movement to user.

• Layout is responsive starting from screen width 480px and up.

• Layout is semantic and accessible with keyboard only.

• I've added validation of all user's input points.

## Possible improvement

• Better testing. I covered main cases, of course, but more time - more quality.

• Same with javascript naming and optimization.

• Full mobile device support (starting from 375px like iPhone mini).
